Why use Redis for Session Storage?
=====================================
Redis is an in-memory database that can store and persist multiple data formats. We will 
use Redis as an in-memory data store to save sessions. Reasons for using Redis storage in 
this use case include the following:

Due to security reasons, it is not advisable to save session IDs in the browser. Redis 
makes a good choice to save the session on the server side.
Easy to manage session caches. You can log out of the current browser session anytime using 
the Redis session cache.
You donâ€™t need to manually encrypt any keys for the Redis session, and Redis will handle 
this for you.
Saving a session on the client means higher CPU usage is required to ensure the safe 
transfer of data, and this is not the case when using an in-memory database such as Redis.
